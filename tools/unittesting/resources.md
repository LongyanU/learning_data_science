## The Four-Phase Test Pattern

The Four-Phase Test Pattern is described in Gerard Meszaros' book "xUnit Testing Patterns" and is a nice clear way to structure your tests. It allows the reader to easily see what is being testing and greatly increases the documentation value of the test.

* Setup - Establish the preconditions to the test.
* Exercise - Do something to the system.
* Verify - Check the expected outcome.
* Cleanup - Return the system under test to its initial state after the test.
